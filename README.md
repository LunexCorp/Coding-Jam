# Coding Jam

**Coding Jam** is a collaborative project between [CEO of LunexCorp](https://github.com/LunexCorp) and [JancoNel](https://github.com/JancoNel).

We receive a random coding idea or theme (excluding games) and challenge ourselves to code it using one of several programming languages.

## About

- Coding Jam is an ongoing activity.  No rounds.
- New coding ideas or themes (no games!) are picked at random.
- We implement each idea in one or more of the following languages:
  - Python
  - C / C++
  - Lua
  - Delphi

## Timeline

- Coding Jam runs from **Friday to Sunday** if we have time.

## How It Works

1. Receive a random coding idea or theme (excluding games).
2. Each participant implements the idea using their language of choice.
3. Share, review, and learn from each other's solutions.

## Themes

Below is a list of all Coding Jam themes.

| #  | Theme / Idea                           | Date       |Link    |
